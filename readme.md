## To use:
* Download this repo
* Make sure all python dependencies are satisfied by running pip install -r requirements.txt
* Navigate to the flask-app directory, run server.py
 
## Future plans:
* Figure out how to tune the model to increase its accuracy - right now, its predictions on non-training data are very inconsistent
